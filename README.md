🌟 Python Internship at Main Flow – Task 1 🌟
Excited to share my first task as part of my Python Internship at Main Flow! 
💡 Task 1 Overview:
 I worked on fundamental Python programs, focusing on problem-solving and logic building. The tasks included:
 ✅ Sum of Two Numbers – Simple addition of two integers.
 ✅ Odd or Even Check – Determining if a number is odd or even.
 ✅ Factorial Calculation – Computing factorial using loops or libraries.
 ✅ Fibonacci Sequence – Generating the first 'n' numbers in the Fibonacci series.
 ✅ String Reversal – Reversing a given string efficiently.
 ✅ Palindrome Check – Checking if a string reads the same backward.
 ✅ Leap Year Check – Identifying leap years based on divisibility rules.
 ✅ Armstrong Number – Verifying if a number equals the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits.
📌 Learning Outcome: These tasks reinforced my understanding of core Python concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, and string manipulations.
